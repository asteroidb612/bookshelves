# bookshelves

## Rendering
We want to generate lots and lots of images of bookshelves. We'll do this with SVG and Elm.
### Done:
- We can render a few books in one style with arbitrary titles. They're sideways and look like books.
### TODO: 
- Make arbitrary amounts of books
- Make different styles of books
- Randomly generate the titles of the books
- Make different shelving layouts 
- Make more photorealistic

## Gathering
We need to get our pretty Elm/SVG book images into something we can train on. This is probably some large, large, large folder 
and will probably depend on our ML Library preferences. Python + Selenium has a screenshot feature that should let us render 
our book images in a browser then turn them into images and file them away nicely. 
### Done:
:|
### TODO:
- Figure out how we want things organized.
- Write a python script to grab it
- Make it faast

## ML Training
The purpose of our fancu book images is to train ml to make them into useful information about real life book shelves. 
### Done: 
### TODO: 
- Pick a framework (https://github.com/spearow/juice, https://github.com/alexandermorozov/leaf)?
- Teach computers how to be people 
- ...
- Profit
